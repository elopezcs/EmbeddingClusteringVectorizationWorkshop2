    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to transform words into vector representations.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **Skip-gram** is a training approach used in Word2Vec that **predicts context words given a center word**.\n",

    "> 🔑 Goal: For a given target word, predict the words that are likely to appear nearby in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📚 How Does Skip-gram Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The field of natural language processing is growing.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the center word is `\"natural\"` and the window size is 2, the context window is:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "[\"of\", \"natural\", \"language\", \"processing\"]\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 The model **learns embeddings** by trying to **maximize the probability** of seeing context words given the center word.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📐 The Skip-gram Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip-gram model aims to maximize the following log-likelihood objective over a large corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\sum_{-c \\leq j \\leq c, j \\neq 0} \\log P(w_{t+j} \\mid w_t)\n",

    "#### **Step 5 – Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical clustering successfully produced a linkage matrix of shape (477 × 4), which corresponds to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 477 merge operations (because clustering a vocabulary of 478 words requires V-1 merges)\n",
    "   - Each row representing:\n",
    "     * cluster/word index 1  \n",
    "     * cluster/word index 2  \n",
    "     * distance at which they were merged  \n",
    "     * size of the newly formed cluster  \n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the structure, we plotted a truncated dendrogram using the top 20 clusters for readability. The dendrogram shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Early (low-distance) merges between words with very similar co-occurrence distributions, such as common function words and punctuation marks.\n",
    "- Larger merges happening at higher distances, representing groups of words that share only broad contextual similarities.\n",
    "- The tall vertical lines near the top of the plot indicate clusters that are highly distinct from one another, demonstrating meaningful structure  \n",
    "  even from this small slice of the Brown corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that the distributional patterns captured in the co-occurrence matrix are strong enough to produce coherent word clusters, even before  \n",
    "learning embeddings. Ward’s method helps visualize these relationships by progressively joining the most similar words and clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical clustering step builds an important conceptual bridge between raw co-occurrence features and the dense vector embeddings\n",
    "we learn next using Word2Vec and GloVe."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Talking Point:**  \n",
    "   -  Ward’s method was chosen because it minimizes the variance within clusters, making the hierarchy more interpretable. Using other linkage methods (e.g., single or complete linkage) would produce very different cluster shapes and potentially less meaningful merges."

    "### **Step 6 – Visualizing the Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrogram)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A dendrogram provides a visual representation of the hierarchical clustering performed using Ward’s method. Each leaf represents a word, and words that merge at smaller distances have more similar co-occurrence patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the vocabulary contains 478 words, plotting the full dendrogram can become cluttered and difficult to interpret. Therefore, we visualize a \n",
    "truncated dendrogram, which shows only the major clusters at higher levels while preserving the overall hierarchical structure."

    "The truncated dendrogram provides a clear and interpretable view of the major clusters produced using Ward’s hierarchical clustering method. Instead of displaying all 478 vocabulary words—which would result in an unreadable plot—the visualization shows the top 25 cluster merges, summarizing the higher-level structure of the corpus.\n",

    "From the dendrogram, we observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Several clusters merge at low distances, indicating groups of words that share very similar co-occurrence profiles in the Brown sentences.\n",
    "- Mid-level merges form larger clusters composed of these smaller groups, reflecting broader patterns of contextual similarity.\n",
    "- A few merges occur at significantly higher distances, shown by the taller vertical lines on the right side of the plot. These represent clusters that are contextually more distinct from the rest of the vocabulary.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Using the Brown Corpus, we extracted a real-world sample of sentences and constructed a complete vocabulary of 478 unique tokens.\n",
    "   - A co-occurrence matrix was built using a sliding context window of size 2, capturing how often words appear near each other. This matrix forms the basis for many classical distributional semantics models.\n",
    "   - We applied hierarchical clustering (Ward’s method) to group words based on similarities in their co-occurrence patterns. The resulting linkage matrix revealed meaningful structure, demonstrating how words cluster together according to shared contextual behavior.\n",
    "   - A truncated dendrogram was used to visualize the top-level clusters, providing an interpretable view of major word groupings without overwhelming the reader with all 478 leaves.\n",
    "   - These steps collectively demonstrate how raw text can be transformed into structured numerical representations that expose linguistic patterns.  \n",
    "  This workflow serves as a foundational pipeline for more advanced embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and other vector-based \n",
    "  distributional models."

    "\n",
    "A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that shows how clusters are formed step-by-step during hierarchical clustering. \n",
    "   - Each leaf represents a word or cluster. \n",
    "   - Leaves that merge at low distances share similar co-occurrence patterns. \n",
    "   - Tall horizontal lines indicate merges between clusters that are more dissimilar.\n",
    "   - The x-axis shows distance (dissimilarity level).\n",
    "   - The y-axis shows cluster groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Tells Us**\n",
    "   - Words that occur in similar contexts are grouped early (small distance).\n",
    "   - More general or widely-used words tend to merge later at larger distances.\n",
    "   - The tree structure shows how clusters grow from small groups into broader categories as the similarity threshold relaxes.\n",

    "Although this notebook does **not** implement GloVe training directly, it is important to understand how the steps we completed relate to the GloVe model.\n",

    "**What GloVe Is**\n",
    "GloVe (Global Vectors) is a word embedding method that learns dense vector representations of words using the global co-occurrence matrix of a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was introduced in 2014 by Pennington, Socher, and Manning at Stanford University.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Relates to Our Notebook**\n",
    "The co-occurrence matrix we constructed in Step 4 is exactly the kind of data GloVe uses during training. GloVe takes this matrix and optimizes word vectors so that:\n",
    "   - words with similar co-occurrence patterns - have similar embeddings  \n",
    "   - rare or noisy co-occurrences - receive lower influence via the weighting function  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our pipeline so far builds the foundational components needed for GloVe:\n",
    "   - cleaned text  \n",
    "   - vocabulary  \n",
    "   - word-index mappings  \n",
    "   - co-occurrence matrix  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why We Do Not Train GloVe Here**\n",
    "Training a full GloVe model requires:\n",
    "   - large corpora\n",
    "   - long training times\n",
    "   - specialized C extensions or optimized libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop instead focuses on understanding the steps that lead up to embedding models such as GloVe and Word2Vec, and visualizing the structure \n",
    "captured by co-occurrence statistics using hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "The clustering performed earlier shows why models like GloVe work: they rely on the same distributional patterns that we visualized through \n",
    "the dendrogram. This provides an intuitive understanding of how embedding models ultimately represent word similarity.\n"
